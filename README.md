# propbank-development
Repository for the full history (and ongoing development branches) of Propbank frames. Do *not* use this repository for SRL -- the data released in https://github.com/propbank/propbank-release is matched to a particular snapshot of frames, which we've placed in https://github.com/propbank/propbank-frames . We will update these frames more regularly, but do not currently plan to manually push those updates into the annotated data (which often requires manual annotation and cannot be easily done on a rolling basis).
