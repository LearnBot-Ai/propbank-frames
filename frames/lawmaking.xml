         <note>This roleset can be viewed as a special instance of making.01, where the former arg1 (law) is tacked into the verb. The new arg1 expresses the specific domain the law applies to. Former args 2 and 3, materials and benefactive, are not expected with this more specific sense. (from lawmaking.01-n)</note>
