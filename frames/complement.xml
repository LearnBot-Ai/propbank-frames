         <note>COMPLEMENT-V NOTES: I have a vague intuition that complement might take an agent at somepoint, hence starting arg numbering at 1. And even if no agent everappears, it seems weird to call the first half of a complementary pairthe arg0, since it's not agentive. (from complement.01-v)</note>
