<text>I was scared ; I had already almost passed the bend , but I saw the large front of a car rushing toward me , and by then it was too late to avoid it , so I turned the steering - wheel to the right , and in the end there was no frontal impact .</text>
<note>Empty 'it' generally indicates the use of this sense. This instance is tricky because of the CXN. The 'to avoid it' phrase could be interpreted as the arg2 of late.02 if the subject were a concrete entity, but here, it's part of the CXN "[too][to avoid it]". This proposition boils down to 'it was late (in the span of time during which events are taking place)'.</note>
