<note>Frames file for 'recognize' based on sentences in financial
  subcorpus.</note>
</predicate>

<note>This frameset was/is kind of a mess. It was very difficult to see where the line between the two senses should be drawn based on the examples/descriptions. .02 was apparently added after .01, and I don't think the examples in .01 were edited after .02 was added to account for there being a new sense. I honestly can't tell where sight-30.2 should go, either. When it's come up in the corpus, it has ended up seeming more like .01; but it also seems to be distinct from publicly acknowledgin/applauding, because of the ambiguity in usages like "Marks &amp; Spencer sees big potential in Brooks Brothers , noting the widely recognized name". I have no idea what's going on, and I'm moving on now. If I had been responsible for adding .02, I would have made it 'finding a stimulus familiar' or some such. gross gross gross.</note>
