            <text>The reason for saying he is &quot; audacious &quot; is that , as a public servant , he violently beat others over a minor disagreement ; furthermore , he used a great deal of violence such as &quot; choking &quot; and &quot; kicking heavily with his feet , &quot; resulting in a &quot; left scapula fracture and left clavicle dislocation &quot; ; we therefore see how despotic Li is and how low his quality is during ordinary times .</text>
