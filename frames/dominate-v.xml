	<note>Frames file for 'dominate' based on sentences in financial  subcorpus.  Verbnet class contiguous_location-47.8, other framed  members include 'contain' 'cover' 'fill' 'support' and 'top'.  I  don't think those are the sense 'dominate' is usually used in,  though.  Using 'surpass' sense of 'top'.</note>
