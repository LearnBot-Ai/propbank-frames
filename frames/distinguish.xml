      <note>When arg1 is singular, there's a default arg2 along the lines of "fromhis/her/its peers".  When arg2 is plural and potentially introduced bya preposition like "between" or "among" the figure (arg1) and ground(arg2) have been merged. (from distinguish.01-v)
With nominal rels, arg0 may be realized as the distinguishing characteristic itself. See example. (from distinction.01-n)</note>
