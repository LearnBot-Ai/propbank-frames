         <note>When arg1 is singular, there's a default arg2 along the lines of &quot;fromhis/her/its peers&quot;.  When arg2 is plural and potentially introduced bya preposition like &quot;between&quot; or &quot;among&quot; the figure (arg1) and ground(arg2) have been merged. (from distinguish.01-v)
With nominal rels, arg0 may be realized as the distinguishing characteristic itself. See example. (from distinction.01-n)</note>
