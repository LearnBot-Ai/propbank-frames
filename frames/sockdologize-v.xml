<note>As far as I know, Harry Hawk in "Our American Cousin" is the only person to utter this. 

"Our American Cousin" is the play Abraham Lincoln was watching when he was killed. John Wilkes Boothe timed his shot to coincide with (and be covered up by) the laugheter following THIS line! Any other usages I've seen in google search are recursive, making direct reference to that particular line, and seem to mean "to refer the usage of word 'sockdologize' in 'Our American Cousin' ". We MIGHT need a frame for that at some point, but it's probably sage to go ahead and wait-- Julia.</note>
