         <note>DISEASE NOTES: Rolesets reconfigured for THYME-AMR. We created an .02 roleset and merged the old .01 roleset into it for naming reasons (rather than simply using the existing diseased-01)-- 'disease' is a much preferred name over 'diseased'. In this case, the roleset his high-frequency enough for such a change to be worthwhile. </note>
         <note>DISEASED-J NOTES: Based on Thyme and Sharpe data. Slight comparison to infect.01. Infect.01 is a member of VN class fill-9.8. Framed by Katie. (from diseased.01-j)</note>
