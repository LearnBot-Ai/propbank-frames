      <note>DISAPPOINT-V NOTES: As with 'surprise', the line between verbal passives and adjectivalsis almost nonexistent. Note, for example, that the Ford example abovecan be easily paraphrased as "That Ford didn't move to tender a bidfor control of the company disappointed the market." (For thisreason, the complementizer MUST be included in the arg.) (from disappoint.01-v)</note>
