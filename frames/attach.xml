      <note>ATTACH-V NOTES: Gag. (from attach.01-v)</note>
      <note>ATTACHMENT-N NOTES: Based on Thyme and Sharp data. Slight comparison to attach.01. Attach.01 is a member of VN class shake-22.3-2-1. No FN class.Framed by Katie (from attachment.01-n)</note>
      <note>ATTACHED-J NOTES: Roleset based on BOLT P01. (from attached.01-j)</note>
      <note>Note that multiple arg-1 tags are possible in a single instance. (from attach.01-v)
I've added an arg 2 so we no longer have multiple arg 1s appearing (from attachment.01-n)Roles differ from verb roles for attach.01 because verb conflated two objects into one arg. (from attached.01-j)</note>
