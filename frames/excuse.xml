      <note>EXCUSE-N NOTES: Roleset based on instances in BOLT p01, part 4. This is etymologically, but no longer syntactically related to the verb excuse.01. WordSketch provides no indication that "excuse" is ever used in the sense expressed by verb excuse: to relieve from responsibility, etc. (from excuse.01-n)</note>
