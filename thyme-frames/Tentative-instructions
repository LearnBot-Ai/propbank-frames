Michael is generating xml files automatically based on the xml csv spreadsheet. 
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O0ChXCbFkbRamnfUeYZegInwnNOSDdniicncDrPhnQI/edit#gid=513269126)

Column A in this spreadsheet is marked 00 when files have up-to-date xml files generated and put into the 
appropriate github folders. If changes are made to the files in the spreadsheet, column A is marked '11'. 
This signals to Michael that a new xml file should be generated. (Once the file is generated, '11' should 
be changed back to '00'.)

Generated files that have a name that is the same as a pre-existing xml file in the propbank-development 
master list go into the thyme-frames/overlap folder.

Generated files that have a novel name go into the thyme-frames/non-overlap folder.

For all of the files that are in the overlap folder, Julia is going in and manually merging them with the 
pre-existing files of the same name. Julia is doing this work in her own folder on the verbs server-- the 
merged files can be found at /home/verbs/student/bonnj/THYME/merged-xmls. After the files are merged, Julia
will put the new versions into a new folder called overlap-merged and then delete the unmerged versions out 
of the overlap folder. This way, Julia will be able to tell that any new xml files that show up in the overlap
folder are revised versions-- Julia will make the appropriate updates in the files on the verbs server and 
copy them into the merged-file folder, then deleting the completed files from the overlap folder once again.

The automatically-generated files are all missing some elements, such as fleshing out the examples and 
adding notes. These parts are not important for MS-AMR set-up, but should be added before formally publishing
the files. 

Eventually, fully completed files should be put into a new THYME branch under probank-development. This hasn't 
been created yet.
